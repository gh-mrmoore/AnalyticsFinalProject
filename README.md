# Overview
Human trafficking is a worldwide problem that affects millions of people. Traffickers use other humans to generate a profit for themselves at the victim’s expense. The most vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking are those who’s basic needs are unmet. The lack of necessities is one of the ways traffickers will prey on victims. Most trafficked victims believe they are indebted to their traffickers in some way or are controlled by the trauma bond they develop with their trafficker. Identifying the signs of human trafficking will help to prevent people from becoming prey to traffickers’ tactics and ensure that current victims can get the help they need to leave.

# Human Trafficking
Merriam-Webster.com describes human trafficking as, organized criminal activity in which human beings are treated as possessions to be controlled and exploited (as by being forced into prostitution or involuntary labor).
## Questions?
### What are some types of human trafficking?
Indentured servitude or forced labor: Victims are recruited through false promises forced to work excessive hours to pay off unpayable debts. 
Sex: the recruitment, transportation, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of sexual exploitation. 

### What are signs someone is a victim of human trafficking?
Indentured servitude or forced labor: 
They lack the freedom to come and go as they please, may even lack knowledge of their whereabouts.  They are not allowed to keep their personal possessions such as ID or other legal documents as well as their earned money as a way for the traffickers to keep them from leaving. May be controlled through violence or assault. They are denied access to basic needs or medical care. 
Sex:  
Any signs of labor trafficking, may notice someone is hiding bruises, scars, marks or tattoos (for branding), Frequent or unstable housing, Involvement in commercial sex industry, being controlled or manipulated by another person.

### What are Key signs someone is being trafficked?
•	Persons social group drastically changes.
•	Person starts talking and acting differently about things like sex, partying, and drugs.
•	Starts dressing differently. 
•	Has possessions they can’t afford
•	Female students always have hair and nails done (could be a sign of grooming).
•	Dating or spending time with someone who is much older. 
•	Controlled and manipulated by another person and isn’t allowed to make their own choices or go where they want to. 
•	Talks about unusual sexual experiences or selling sex acts. 
•	Hides bruises, cuts or scars.
•	Tattoos of pimp’s name, money bag, or barcode.
•	Acting out sexually, exhibiting aggressive anger or doing opposite appearing withdrawn reclusive. Person’s attitude is completely different from normal behavior.
•	Using drugs or involved in a gang.

### Why do victims of sex trafficking not report their abuse?
•	Fear of not being believed.
•	Feels shameful for what has happened to them
•	Fear of retaliation from their trafficker
•	Fear of criminal charges for their involvement
•	They believe the exploitation isn’t as bad as what they will face if they sought help
•	Fear of threats to family members
•	Blackmail or threats from trafficker
•	May be confused or disoriented or developed a substance dependency
•	Most have developed a trauma bond with their trafficker giving them a feeling of a strong emotional bond. Has a strong neurological impact on victims and is more powerful than a physical constraint. 

## Does Gender play a role in human trafficking?
Though it seems that mostly women and young girls are affected by sexual trafficking, it is believed that males are just as victimized as females. Unfortunately, due to embarrassment or shame, most will not come forward more so than females. Male victims are often recruited directly by buyers rather than a third-party trafficker. This gives most victims a sense of agency, which makes them feel in control of the situation therefore they do not feel as though they are being victimized. Most are drawn in by the buyer who is offering to meet their needs and provides them with a sense of belonging. Labor trafficking is the area males are not as ashamed to come forward.

### What ways are people targeted by traffickers?
Labor:
•	Low education
•	Dept to be paid
•	Immigration status 
•	Poverty
Sex:
•	History of abuse
•	Substance of abuse
•	Homelessness

### What are Key Signs to look for if you believe a child is being trafficked?
•	Victims work late at night while still in school
•	They are taken to other cities to work on weekends
•	Students start skipping school
•	Running away or travel a lot

### How do traffickers recruit their victims?
Tactics of Traffickers:
•	Violence: Use violence or threats of against victims or their loved ones
•	Lies or False Promises: Job offers, offers money, making dreams come true, success, and freedom as bait. 
•	BeFriend: Gain victim trust, help them out buying them what they need or want overtime convincing victim that they owe them and need to give something back 
•	Romancing: Gains love and devotion of victim, (boy friending) this is the most common way traffickers initiate a relationship with potential victim

### What are the four components of human trafficking?
•	Force 			
•	Coercion
•	Fraud 			
•	Facilitated by a third party or a group of people

### What are the four stages of sex trafficking?
Luring stage:
•	Assessing the victim by collecting as much information as possible to use later
•	Testing vulnerabilities and boundaries
•	Determine if you will buy into what he is selling 
•	Testing waters to see, if possible, victim is open to engage in courting
•	Making them feel special
Grooming and Gaming:
•	Makes victim feel like they are in love
•	Makes promises to fulfill victims most desired dreams
•	Makes victim feel special
•	May engage in physical intimacy
•	May introduce victim to illicit drugs
Coercion and Manipulation:
•	Starts sending mixed messages
•	Confuses victim by withdrawing
•	Uses information gained against them
•	Reduces information and compliments
•	Makes victim feel he is mad at them
•	Toys with emotions and behaves erratically to cause victim to question how he feels about them
•	Makes victim want to try and please them any way they can to get back in their good grace
•	They began asking victim to do things sexually that the victim is uncomfortable with to desensitize them to these actions
•	Has sex with victim and then does something for victim such as taking them shopping
•	giving them money or favors to associate sex with payment
•	Makes victim feel indebted to them
Exploitation:
•	Breaks down victims’ self-esteem
•	Threatens victim or their loved ones-based information collected in luring stage
•	Makes victim feel indebted to them
•	Makes victim feel obligated to repay or contribute in some way
•	Isolates victim from family and friends so that they believe trafficker is only one who cares for them making it harder for them to reach out for help, as well as to change victim as much as possible to create a new identity

## Human Trafficking

## Purpose
Search for trends in human trafficking, through data, in order to predict possible outcomes, based on gender, age, immigration status, among others, and how these relate to the activity the victims are forced into.

## Choosing
Our initial thoughts on the matter where how awful this situations is, across the country as well as around the world. So, as a way to evoke consciousness maybe, or as a personal exercise of empathy, we decided to work with this dataset, trying to discover what story could it be telling us. 

## Source of data
Our analysis is based on a csv file, consisting of 63 columns and nearly 50,000 rows of data.
In columns we have year, gender, age, majority status(when trafficked started for them),  tactics to scare, threat or maintain the power relationship between the victims and their "recruiter".
Type of labor is another interesting column, wich will take our attention later in the machine learning model.
Finally the recruiter relation to the victims is shown. 

## Questions?
### Does the victim's age, gender, relationship to their recruiter and citizenship predict the type of exploitation?
Polaris-reported human trafficking appears to fall in to one of five major types of exploitation: sexual, forced labor, forced marriage, slavery and other/multiple exploits.
*Placeholder text pending further research and consolidation of group efforts to this point.*

### Is it possible to predict the type of labor a trafficking victim may be forced in to given age, gender, recruiter relationship, citizenship and type of control?
There are several categories of forced labor reported, although data is not as complete as for other features.
*Placeholder text pending further research and consolidation of group efforts to this point.*

### Is it possible to predict the number of trafficking victims based on certain economic factors (such as GDP and unemployment rate)?
Does high unemployment and/or low economic productivity increase the likelihood that trafficking may be more prevalent in a given country?
*Placeholder text pending further research and consolidation of group efforts to this point.*

## Machine Learning Model
### Data Pre-Processing
Many features/columns had to be consolidated and combined to prevent data loss. Each Jupyter Notebook has additional details.

### Feature Engineering
As we had a known outcome (our Polaris dataset related to known victims of human trafficking), a supervised learning model with multi-class logistic regression was chosen. This required that categorical data be converted to numerical and, in certain instances, scaled due to the disparities between certain features. Features were chosen based on research i to human trafficking and based on the data publicly available.

### Training/Testing Splits
Data was split in to training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` module available in Sci-Kit Learn. Modifications to the sets are pending further EDA and review.

### Model Choice
After initial trials with unsupervised and neural-network learning models, consultations led us to a supervised learning model. Using both multi-class logistic regression and linear regression, we hope to be able to predict outcomes to our questions as listed above. As yet, multiple regression (using various factors to try and forecast the number of cases in a given country for a given year) has proven less than reliable.

## Database Integration
### Data Storage
Our project is using PostgreSQL hosted via Heroku (heroku.com).

### Project interface
Our database hosts migrated historical data from a variety of sources that is linked to our models using SQLAlchemy.

### Schema
Our database includes at least 4 primary data tables.
<img src="https://github.com/gh-mrmoore/AnalyticsFinalProject/blob/main/Segment-2/Database/ERD.png" alt="Basic ERD for PostgreSQL database." />

### Joins
SQL was used to create a view within the database that provides a reference between 2-character and 3-character country ISO codes.

### SQLAlchemy Connection String
As we upload our cleaned data to the database and then draw that data down from the database for analysis in our models, multiple connections were made using SQLAlchemy. The connection strings have not been pushed to GitHub as they are they relate to a live database.

## Communication Protocols
### Needs
As each team member will contribute to different parts of the project over time, communication throughout each segmenet of the project is essential. Communication will be maintained regularly meetings will be planned according to team members' schedules.

### Tools
We plan to use a combination of Jupyter Notebooks, Python, plotly, MapBox, d3 and likely other libraries to, hopefully, host our project on Heroku.

### Interactive Elements
Best case scenario will be an interactive use of our models. We also plan to have interactive heat maps on various statistics and charts. Deployment particulars may affect this goal. A rough mock-up of our site is below:

*Initial layout taken from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_templates.asp)*

### Purpose
Efficient collaboration between teammates can either make or break a project. Communication, as part of collaboration is essential for success. Regular updates to stakeholders can help to remove blockages from a given workflow and can allow parallel development of different aspects of a given project without one necessarily waiting on another.

### Methods
#### GitHub Projects
A basic Kanban project has been created in the Project GitHub repository. This will enable team members to track progress as items are completed.

#### Slack
Using Slack to message other team members and share resources will be essential. Sharing links and possibly files via Slack should improve the quality of work.

#### Zoom
Regular Zoom meetings (both during and outside of regular class time) will be held to accomplish the following:
- Brainstorm
- Troubleshoot
- Plan for next steps
- Debate and determine best models and/or datasets and/or technologies

#### Canvas
As provided by the class instructor and teaching assistants, a calendar and other resources are available in Canvas. Meetings will be posted on the calendar and other resources (Collaborations, Files, Discussions, etc) shall be utilized when or if appropriate.

### Cadence
The group shall meet at least twice weekly (Monday and Wednesday during regularly scheduled class time) and as often as possible or necessary outside of the regular, twice-weekly, meetings.

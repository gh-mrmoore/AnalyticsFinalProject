# Final Analysis Project
## Human trafficking in North America

## Purpose
Search for trends in human trafficking through data, in order to predict possible outcomes, based on gender, age, immigration status, among others, and how these relate to the activity the victims are forced into.

## Reasons for choosing
Our initial thoughts on the matter where how awful this situations is, across the country as well as around the world. So, as a way to evoke consciousness maybe, or as a personal exercise of empathy, we decided to work with this dataset, trying to discover what story could be telling us 

## Source of data
Our analysis is based on a csv file, consisting of 63 columns and nearly 50,000 rows of data.
In columns we have year, gender, age, majority status(when trafficked started for them),  tactics to scare, threat an maintain power relasionship between the victims and their "recruiter".
Type of labor is another interesting column, wich will take our attention later in the machine learning model.
Finally the recruiter relation to the victims is shown 

## Questions?
Is age, gender or immigration status related to the type of labor people will be forced into?

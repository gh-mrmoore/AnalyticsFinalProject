# Analytics Final Project

## Human Trafficking

## Purpose
Search for trends in human trafficking, through data, in order to predict possible outcomes, based on gender, age, immigration status, among others, and how these relate to the activity the victims are forced into.

## Choosing
Our initial thoughts on the matter where how awful this situations is, across the country as well as around the world. So, as a way to evoke consciousness maybe, or as a personal exercise of empathy, we decided to work with this dataset, trying to discover what story could it be telling us. 

## Source of data
Our analysis is based on a csv file, consisting of 63 columns and nearly 50,000 rows of data.
In columns we have year, gender, age, majority status(when trafficked started for them),  tactics to scare, threat or maintain the power relationship between the victims and their "recruiter".
Type of labor is another interesting column, wich will take our attention later in the machine learning model.
Finally the recruiter relation to the victims is shown. 

## Questions?
Is age, gender or immigration status, related to the type of labor people will be forced into?


## Communication Protocols
### Needs
As each team member will contribute to different parts of the project over time, communication throughout each segmenet of the project is essential. Communication will be maintained regularly meetings will be planned according to team members' schedules.

### Purpose
Efficient collaboration between teammates can either make or break a project. Communication, as part of collaboration is essential for success. Regular updates to stakeholders can help to remove blockages from a given workflow and can allow parallel development of different aspects of a given project without one necessarily waiting on another.

### Methods
#### GitHub Projects
A basic Kanban project has been created in the Project GitHub repository. This will enable team members to track progress as items are completed.

#### Slack
Using Slack to message other team members and share resources will be essential. Sharing links and possibly files via Slack should improve the quality of work.

#### Zoom
Regular Zoom meetings (both during and outside of regular class time) will be held to accomplish the following:
- Brainstorm
- Troubleshoot
- Plan for next steps
- Debate and determine best models and/or datasets and/or technologies

#### Canvas
As provided by the class instructor and teaching assistants, a calendar and other resources are available in Canvas. Meetings will be posted on the calendar and other resources (Collaborations, Files, Discussions, etc) shall be utilized when or if appropriate.

### Cadence
The group shall meet at least twice weekly (Monday and Wednesday during regularly scheduled class time) and as often as possible or necessary outside of the regular, twice-weekly, meetings.
